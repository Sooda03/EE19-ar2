    <h1>For a better day</h1>
    <p>Paint on a caution wind <br>
        'Neath the bleeding sky<br>
        I called your name<br>
        There was no one there<br>
        And in the cold and snow<br>
        I saw your face</p>
    <p>And we sang our song for the little thing<br>
        Magic calm, but the joy you bring<br>
        Running it down the line<br>
        Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing<br>
        Magic calm from a pretty thing<br>
        Maybe it might be time<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day</p>
    <p>Straight, from the path of love<br>
        In the road of life<br>
        I tumble forward<br>
        But I'm going on<br>
        I'ma keep it strong<br>
        I saw your face</p>
    <p>And we sang our song for the little thing<br>
        Magic calm, but the joy you bring<br>
        Running it down the line<br>
        Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing<br>
        Magic calm from a pretty thing<br>
        Maybe it might be time<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day<br>
        For a better day</p>
    <p>And we sang our song for the little thing<br>
        Magic calm, but the joy you bring<br>
        Running it down the line<br>
        Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing<br>
        Magic calm from a pretty thing<br>
        Maybe it might be time<br>
        For a better day</p>
